					<p class="center-align caps">Secretary General</p>
					<p class="center-justified">Born and raised in Brussels, Gustave grew up in a French/Flemish environment. His hunger for knowledge and his multidisciplinary interests inspired him to major in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at EUC. He first encountered MUN in high school and attended various conferences since then. He co-organized the very first EUCMUN and works now on further making it a high-quality conference. Next to MUN, Gustave is organizing activities and summer camps for a scouting movement in Brussels. If he is not dreaming about skying, you will find him enjoying a {Dutch/good} beer. He is looking forward to welcome you in (online) Rotterdam and excited to share with you the ERASMUN experience!</p>

He has always been passionate about MUNs, mostly being a delegate and representing smaller portfolios but making a big impact, recently he has gotten into policy writing, debates, and chairing. In his free time you can find Mo munching on jellybeans and sometimes being a DJ. Looking forward to a fruitful committee discussion, hopefully with some ground-breaking yet grounded ideas.</p>

I am a second year at the Erasmus University College in Rotterdam and am currently majoring in Politics, Philosophy and Economy (PPE). I am originally French but lived most of my life in The Hague. In high school, I attended and participated in multiple MUN conferences. Each event can provide you with a chance to improve personal skills including debating, public speaking and policy making. I hope that ERASMUN provides you with that same opportunity during the current pandemic. Hope to see you all on the 10th of April!</p>

She finds it important to gain an interdisciplinary insight in different paradigms in order to gain broader understanding of what is happening in the world around us, zoomed in or zoomed out.<br>Although Bibiana has only recently joined MUN, she considers being a part of the committee a great opportunity to familiarize herself with the MUN community and to put her organizational skills into practice. As acting UDG of Finance, her responsibility will be to control the budget and to allocate sponsors and funds. In spite of the unusual current situation, Bibiana is committed to make this year’s online ERASMUN an outstanding, high quality event!</p>

She has always enjoyed the behind-the-scenes of the event, and participated as part of the Press Team in several events, until being awarded the Head of Press Position in her high school’s Board of Directors. As soon as she joined EUC, she knew this committee would give her the opportunity to continue this journey.<br>Dorka is determined to pursue a career in psychology after university, thus interacting with a diverse crowd will give her some training for this. As the UDG of Marketing, Dorka will be the one behind all the social media posts, as well as marketing and advertising our conference and other events. She is responsible for maintaining ERASMUN’s public image and maximising our efforts to connect with the participants of our events. </p>

					<p class="center-justified">Lisa is a second-year student at EUC majoring in PPE. Being half British and half Austrian, she was brought up bilingually and attended an international high school near Vienna, where she organised several independent Modern European Parliament sessions. This provided her with valuable insights revolving around the organisation and execution of such a project. Last January, as a member of the MUN Team, she organised the first ever MUN event at EUC and is excited for this year’s event in April.<br>It is truly fascinating to debate with people from a wide range of backgrounds about global issues and therefore, she is looking forward to her work as the UDG of events. Her main tasks include scheduling the opening & closing ceremony, finding guest speakers for the GA and experts working in the field specific to each committee issue.</p>
